# MUZIO

Muzio is a project made by our team members to make Music fun. The main fun in music not only depends on a device it also depends on the user interface and how the player or controls interacts or behaves with music and also on what features it provides.
So we tried to make it better with this.
The experiments use a variety of tools – Web Audio API, Visulizer.js,3D renderer WebGL, and more. We hope they’re useful as inspiration or reference for anyone who wants to create their own music projects on the web.
